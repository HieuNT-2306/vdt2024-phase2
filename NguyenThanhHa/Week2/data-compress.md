# Data Compression

Data compression is the process of using encoding, restructuring, and other modifications to reduce the size of digital data files without changing their fundamental properties. By reducing the size of files, data compression minimizes the network bandwidth required to share them and the capacity needed to store them, lowering costs. 

# How does Data Compression work ?

At a high level, data compression works by encoding the original, target data in fewer bits, reducing the size of the data. When needed, the data can be uncompressed, or decoded and retrieved.

The process involves two algorithmsâ€”one for compression and one for reconstruction. The original data is reduced into an encoded representation of itself. When accessing or retrieving the information, the reconstruction algorithm decompresses the data representation into a newer format to make it as similar to the original as possible.

Data compression is valuable because raw data is not ready to use. `Noise and redundancy` can inflate the footprint data occupies needlessly, requiring more storage capacity to retain it and more bandwidth to transmit it over a network. Noisy data refers to data that is distorted, corrupted, or unreadable, while redundant data refers to information that is repeated multiple times within the same dataset.

Data compression is aimed at eliminating redundancy and noise, improving the overall quality of the available information as well as reducing its size.

# Types of Data Compression
Generally speaking, there are four different types of data compression:

- `Text Compression`: primarily uses codes or symbols for patterns and redundancies; reduces overall size, but information remains unaltered.
